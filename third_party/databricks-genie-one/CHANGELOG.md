# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented here.

## 1.0.0 — initial release

- Added the `databricks-genie-one` MCP server pointing at `https://${DATABRICKS_HOST}/ai-gateway/mcp-services/system.ai.genie_one_mcp`.
- Declared `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `CLIENT_ID`, and optional `CLIENT_SECRET` plugin variables for the team's Databricks OAuth app connection, since Databricks has no dynamic client registration.
- Requests the `ai-gateway` and `offline_access` scopes.
- Logo: Databricks' official mark, from the `databricks` GitHub organization.
